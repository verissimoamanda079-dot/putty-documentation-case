# PuTTY Documentation – Tech Writing Case

This repository contains documentation created as part of a **Technical Writing test case**.  
The goal was to demonstrate the ability to explain technical concepts clearly, organize information logically, and present documentation in different formats.

## Available Documents

The PuTTY SSH connection feature was documented in **two formats**:

- [Markdown version](docs/putty-doc-EN.md)  
- [PDF version](docs/putty-doc-EN.pdf)

##  About the Content

The documentation is structured into three parts:

1. **Explanation** – Overview of PuTTY and its SSH functionality.  
2. **Tutorial** – Step-by-step guide on how to establish an SSH connection with PuTTY.  
3. **Reference** – Detailed description of SSH connection parameters.  

##  Objective

The purpose of providing both **Markdown** and **PDF** versions is to showcase flexibility:  
- Markdown for collaborative environments (e.g., GitHub, wikis).  
- PDF for distribution, offline access, or formal presentation.
